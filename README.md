# BBQ

## Purpose

This project is to control an offset barrel BBQ smoker equipped with a fan (DIY addition).

The control logic switches a fan on and off, and the thermocouple provides sensing input.

## Building your own

You will need:

- an offset barrel BBQ smoker. e.g. (Chargriller Super Pro with the firebox addition)
- a metal bucket with a 100mm hole drilled into the bottom
- an arduino
- MAX6675K thermocouple amplifier + K-type thermocouple
- Adafruit Motor Control Shield (v1)
- A 12v fan - a 100mm PC case fan can work, however for faster temperature rise use a 100mm inline 12v bathroom extractor fan + metal ducting.
- 12v powersupply
